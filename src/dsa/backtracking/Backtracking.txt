What is Backtracking?
==============================
- Backtracking is an algorithmic strategy that uses tree recursion
- It's a methodical way to find solutions by exploring all possible candidates
- It incrementally builds a solution, and abandons a path as soon as it fails
- Analogy: You are in a maze. You take a path.
           If you hit a dead end, you "backtrack" to the last junction and try a different path

Backtracking Algorithm Pattern
================================
All backtracking solutions follow this three-step pattern
    - Choose:
      Make a choice (e.g: move 'Right' in the maze).

    - Explore:
      Make a recursive call to see if this choice leads to a valid solution
            - If the recursive call returns true, a solution was found. Pass true up.

    - Un-choose:
      If the call returns false (dead end), undo your choice (backtrack)
            - This "un-choose" step is the most critical part in eventually finding the solution

/*
Pattern 3: Memoization
Problem: Count Ways to Climb Steps (Memoized)
    Problem:
    This is the exact same problem as the "Frog Jump" (Count Ways to Reach the End).

    However, the naive recursive solution is O(2^n) because it re-calculates the same values
    (e.g., Ways(2)) multiple times.

    Task: Fix the slow recursive solution by using a "cache" (an array) to store and
    reuse the results of subproblems.

    Input: n = 30
    Output: 1346269 (This should be computed instantly, not after a long delay).

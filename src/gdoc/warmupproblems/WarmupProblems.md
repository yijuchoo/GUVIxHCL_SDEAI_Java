# Warm Up Problems

## 1. Chai Stall Punch Card
You’re running a chai stall: for every 6 cups a person buys, they get 1 free.
If someone buys 23 cups, how many free chais do they get, and how many total chais do they drink (paid + free)?


## 2. Auto-Rickshaw Fare (tiered pricing)
Base fare is 30 for the first 2 km.
From 2–10 km it’s 13 per km.
After 10 km it’s 15 per km.
If a ride is 9 km, what’s the total fare?


## 3. Cricket Over Countdown
Print a countdown of balls left in an over: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
When you reach 3, print “Strategic talk” once and keep going.
Stop at 1.


## 4. Phone Battery Anxiety
Start with a battery at 17%. Every minute, it drops by 2%.
Print the percentage each minute.
If the battery reaches 5% or less, print “Low Power Mode?” and stop immediately.


## 5. Elevator: Service Mode
A lift serves floors 1 to 10.
From floor 7 upwards, it stops only on even floors (8 and 10).
Simulate the lift going up from floor 1 and print the floors where it stops.
End the run completely when you hit floor 10.


## 6. Step Counter — No Loops Allowed
You have 7 days of step counts stored in seven separate variables:
d1=4200, d2=8300, d3=9100, d4=7800, d5=12000, d6=3000, d7=10050.
Count how many days reached at least 8,000 steps.
Do this without using any loop


## 7. Gym Circuit with a Skip
You plan to do 10 sets. Print “Set X done” for each set number from 1 to 10.
But you must skip set 5 (don’t print it) and still finish the rest.
After the loop, print how many sets you actually completed.

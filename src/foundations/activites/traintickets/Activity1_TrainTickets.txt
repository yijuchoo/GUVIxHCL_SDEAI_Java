Activity 1: Train tickets

- Goal
    - Add SleeperTicket that extends the existing TrainTicket
    - Reuse AcTicket from the previous slide
- Given
    - TrainTicket is abstract with pnr, constructor, int fare(int km), and coachType() default
    - AcTicket implements the AC fare and overrides coachType()
- Design and rules
    - SleeperTicket.fare(km): if km <= 0 return 0, else km * 2
    - Override coachType() to return "Sleeper"
    - Do not change TrainTicket or AcTicket
- Acceptance checks
    - new SleeperTicket().fare(10) -> 20
    - new AcTicket().fare(10) -> 30
    - TrainTicket[] arr = { new SleeperTicket(), new AcTicket() }

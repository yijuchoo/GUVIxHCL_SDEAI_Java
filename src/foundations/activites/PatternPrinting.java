     * Goal:
     *   - Print a Left-aligned triangle of * using a variable rows set at the top (no user input yet)
     *   - The outer loop controls rows; the inner loop prints row number of stars
     * Design rules:
     *   Decide if the last row counts (we'll make it inclusive). Print a newline after each row;
     *   Do not hardcode star counts
     * Consider:
     *   - Declaring a variable, totalRows, and assigning it a value
     *   - for-loop where i starts at 1 and goes to the totalRows, incrementing by 1
     *   - For each iteration of i, a nested loop to perform the printing

Polymorphism: one call, many behaviors

- Polymorphism means one parent type can refer to many child types
        - The call is the same but the behavior depends on the actual object
        - Eg: Notification -> WhatsAppNotification and SMSNotification
- Objects provide their own method bodies
        - Eg: Notification::sendNotification
            -   WhatsAppNotification::sendNotification
            -   SMSNotification::sendNotification
- Runtime dispatch chooses which overridden method runs
        - Eg: notification.sendNotification(); OR whatsAppNotification.sendNotification();
- Storage and loops
        - Use an array of the parent type to hold different child objects
- Boundaries: Methods, not fields, are polymorphic

Inheritance: Reuse with extends
========================================

Inheritance
    - A class reuses another class’s code and adds or tweaks behavior
Parent and child
    - Parent holds shared fields and methods
    - Child gains those and can add its own
extends keyword
    - Declares that one class derives from another
When it helps
    - Two classes share most behavior and only a small rule differs


super: Parent Constructor and Method Calls
----------------------------------------------
super in a constructor
    - Calls the parent’s constructor to set up shared fields
super in a method
    - Calls a parent method and then adds extra steps in the child
Order matters
    - Initialize parent first, then set child fields
Example
    - PrepaidMetroPass passes owner and balance to MetroPass using super


Overriding: Adjust Behavior in a Child Class
----------------------------------------------
What is it?
    - A child supplies its own version of a method defined in the parent
Signature rule
    - Same name, parameters, and return type as the parent method
Use @Override annotation
    - Ensures the method correctly overrides a parent method, catching errors
      (eg: incorrect method signature) at compile time
Reuse, then extend
    - Call super.method(...) to keep parent checks, then add the new rule
Keep the contract
    - Do not weaken input rules or change success meaning

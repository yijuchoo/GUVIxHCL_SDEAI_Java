What is a Class?
    - Blueprint listing fields for data and methods for actions


What is an Object?
    - Concrete thing built from a class with its own values

Fields
    - Named data the object carries, like balance or ownerName

Methods
    - Named actions the object can do, like recharge or deductFare

Independence Rule
    - Two objects of the same class hold different field values

Order
    1. Define the class
    2. Create objects using the class

Eg.
    Class                               |    Object
    ===================================================
    Dog             Create instance     |    Tommy
                    -------------->

    Properties          Methods         |    Property Values         Methods
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Name                getName()       |    Name: Tommy             getName()
    Color               getColor()      |    Color: Green            getColor()
    Eye_Color           getEyeColor()   |    Eye_Color: Brown        getEyeColor()
    Height              getHeight()     |    Height: 17 in           getHeight()
    Length              comeHere()      |    Length: 35 in           comeHere()


Anatomy of Class
----------------------
Class Name
    - Descriptive, PascalCase, matches the filename

Fields
    - Data as nouns. Start simple, set safe defaults where possible

Methods
    - Verbs that read or change fields. One clear job per method

Constructor
    - Special method that sets up a new object at creation time

Access Modifier
    - Keyword that controls who can see a member
        - public, private & protected

Order
    1. Fields
    2. Constructors
    3. Methods

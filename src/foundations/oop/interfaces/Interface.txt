Interfaces
===============================
    - Contracts without shared state

    - What is an interface?
        - A type that declares method signature; implementing classes must provide bodies

        - No shared object state in the interface

    - Use Cases
        - When several classes share a capability; not shared data

        - Eg. Plug in new payment providers without touching callers


Default & Static methods on interfaces
==========================================
- Default method
    - A reusable body shared by impmenters (good for small helpers)

    - Use Case:
        - TO add new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing classes.

- Static method
    - Utility on the interface type

    - It can be called using the interface name.
    Eg. InterfaceName.method()

- Use Cases & Benefits
    - Defaults reduce duplication;
      Static gives a central utility without a class

----------------------------------------------------------

Multiple interfaces: combining capabilities
===============================================
    - One class, many capabilities
        - Implement several small interfaces in one class

    What's combined?
        - Method obligations and default bodies, not fields or state

    Use Cases & Benefits
        - Payments that can also refund; orthogonal features stay decoupled

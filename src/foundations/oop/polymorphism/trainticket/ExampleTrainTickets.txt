Example: Train tickets
===================================
- Consider: in a given train ticket, what usually varies vs what stays?

- Stable data
    - passenger name, travel date, etc

- Varying behavior
    - fare(km) calculation
    - coachType() label

- Design direction
    - Put shared data in a base class
    - Let children supply their own fare(km) and optionally coachType()

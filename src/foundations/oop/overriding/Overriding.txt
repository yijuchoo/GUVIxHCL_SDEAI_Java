Overriding rules that matter
=================================================

    Signature match
        - Same name and parameters; @Override verifies the match

    Access
        - Child access is the same or more open than parent

    Return
        - May be a subtype of the parent’s return (covariant return)

    Final
        - A final method cannot be overridden
        - Applies to variables - a variable declared with final cannot have it’s value changed

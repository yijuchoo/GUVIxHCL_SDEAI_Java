StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

What are they?
    - StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable helper to build text piece by piece
    - Both allow to change the value of a String that is declared and use.
    - They reduce the temporary String objects created by repeated + in loops

Which To Use?
    - Prefer StringBuilder for single-threaded, everyday code.
        - Not ideal for larger-scaled applications -> Require Multi-threading

    - StringBuffer -> Useful for Multi-threading
        - Older, thread-safe variant.
        - When multiple threads access the same string, it will only allow ONE THREAD
          to access a String at a time.

How To Use?
    - Append parts as you go, then call toString() once at the end to get a String

    Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer in Java are mutable classes used to build or
    modify strings efficiently — but they differ mainly in thread safety.

    String
    - Immutable — once created, it cannot be changed.
    - Every time you modify a String (e.g. concatenation), Java actually creates a new String object in memory.
        String s = "Hello";
        s = s + " World"; // creates a new String object
    - ❌ Inefficient when doing lots of concatenation or text modification (e.g. inside loops).

    StringBuilder
    - Mutable — content can be changed without creating new objects.
    - Not thread-safe (❌ not synchronized).
    - Faster than `StringBuffer` for single-threaded operations.
    - ✅ Use when:
        - Your code runs in a single thread (most applications).
        - You want better performance when concatenating strings repeatedly (e.g. loops, file reading, etc).

    StringBuffer
    - Also mutable, but thread-safe.
    - All methods are synchronized, so only one thread can modify the buffer at a time.
    - ✅ Use when:
        - Multiple threads might modify the same string object concurrently.
    - ⚠️ Slightly slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization overhead.
